### **Memory Allocation**

- **Static Allocation**: Memory size is fixed at compile time.
- **Dynamic Allocation**: Memory is allocated during runtime using:
    - `malloc()`, `calloc()`, `realloc()` in C.
    - `new` and `delete` in C++.
    - Automatic garbage collection in languages like Java, Python.

### **Memory Management Techniques**

- **Paging**: Divides memory into fixed-size pages.
- **Segmentation**: Divides memory based on logical sections (e.g., code, stack, heap).
- **Paging + Segmentation**: A hybrid approach used in modern OS.
